# Deploy on phone

- For `Android`, you can follow this [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mpsiO2lCx0). 
- For `iOS`, you can follow this [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu_eG0eTFlA). 
  - Because the project is configured for Android by default, you *might* need to uninstall `ARCore XR Plugin` if it's already installed. For that go in Unity (top of it): **Window** > **Package Manager**, find `ARCore XR Plugin` and uninstall it.

Those tutorials create a new project from scratch, you can do it to test a new basic project and deploy it to your phone. Otherwise, avoid those parts and configure it to work with `Abstract Quiz AWA` project instead.

## Use image/qr code tracking
